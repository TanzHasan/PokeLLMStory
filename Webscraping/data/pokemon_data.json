It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.\nFirst partner Pok\u00e9mon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers.[1] Having been raised by humans from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pok\u00e9mon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment.[2] Bulbasaur have demonstrated a nurturing instinct towards younger, weaker Pok\u00e9mon, one individual even using its vines to pick up a crying Pok\u00e9mon, gently rocking it back and forth through the air while singing a \"Bulba-by\".[3] Its vines are long and strong enough to allow Bulbasaur to grab the branches of trees and pull itself up to reach berries.[4] Bulbasaur can survive for days without even eating a single morsel.[5] As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Bulbasaur is known to sleep in the to sleep in sunny spots.[6]\nIt is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as first partner Pok\u00e9mon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. A Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation.[7] Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.\n\n"

Ivysaur has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth and two pointed teeth in its upper jaw. Each of its feet has three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a large pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud.\nThe weight of the plant prevents Ivysaur from running fast and standing on its hind legs, forcing its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming evolution. Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Ivysaur is known to sleep in sunny spots while undergoing its photosynthesis process. Researchers cannot decide if Ivysaur is awake or asleep during this process.[1] Ivysaur are typically found in plains.\n"

The bud on its back has bloomed into a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur has a seed in the center of its flower.\nVenusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to become more vibrant. The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pok\u00e9mon and calms emotions. This scent becomes stronger after a rainy day. Venusaur is at its strongest in the summertime when there is much more sunlight to absorb. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Venusaur releases a soothing fragrance while sleeping.[1] In the anime, Venusaur has demonstrated the ability to manipulate nature, release several vines from its back, and lead evolution ceremonies for Bulbasaur and Ivysaur.

It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pok\u00e9mon's slender tail and has blazed there since Charmander's birth.\nThe flame can be used as an indication of Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pok\u00e9mon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander would die if its flame were to go out. However, if the Pok\u00e9mon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Charmander is known to sleep while curled up.[1] Supposedly, Charmander is drawing warmth from the flame on its tail. During quiet nights, one can hear the sound of a flame burning if you listen hard enough while Charmander sleeps.\nCharmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. However, it is found far more often in the ownership of Trainers. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap and New Pok\u00e9mon Snap, Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food, and watching the flames on each other's tails to ensure they don't go out.\n\n"

There are two fangs visible in its upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame, which can intensify to a blue flame if Charizard is irritated.\nCharizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath is capable of melting boulders and massive glaciers, and has been known to accidentally cause forest fires. Though its fiery breath is hot, it never turns it on any opponent weaker than itself. Charizard typically inhabits mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. The anime has shown that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. It also showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pok\u00e9mon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. Charizard's wings can carry it to an altitude of 4,600 feet (1,400 meters). Charizard lives in herds with Charmander. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Charizard is known to sleep in a incredibly relaxed position.[1] The is because Charizard is very confident in its own power. Some Charizard are occasionally seen sleeping flat on their backs, which is potentially a sign that those Charizard are especially strong.\nEven though Charizard originally couldn\u2019t learn the move Fly, Trainers have been shown riding Charizard in official artwork dating back to the original Carddass Trading Cards of the year 1997. Ash himself was shown riding his Charizard already in the second season of the original series of the anime. Eventually, in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Charizard became able to learn Fly and has since been frequently depicted as a Pok\u00e9mon able to carry people on its back to fly them to distant areas.

Each of its hands and feet have three pointed digits. The end of its long, squirrel-like tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves.\nSquirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance, allowing the Pok\u00e9mon to swim at high speeds. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes. The anime has shown that it can be found living on secluded islands with other members of its evolutionary line. Sharpedo is a natural predator of Squirtle. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Squirtle is known to sleep by withdrawing its limbs and head into its shell.[1] It does this to protect itself from threats while sleeping. It also on occasion, rocks contentedly from side to side while sleeping.\nIn Generation II, Squirtle and its evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\n"

A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail is a popular symbol of longevity and good luck, making this Pok\u00e9mon popular with the elderly.\nBecause they are larger than Squirtle and have a larger shell, Wartortle have a more difficult time walking on land and keeping their balance in the water. To maintain balance while swimming at high speeds, Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail as both rudders and balancing rods. Air can be stored in its fur for extended underwater diving. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. The anime has shown that Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands, but its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes.

Its feet have three claws on the front and one on the back. Poking out of the bottom of its shell is a stubby tail.\nThe powerful cannons on this Pok\u00e9mon's back are capable of producing water blasts that can pierce steel and concrete and can be used for high-speed charges. The speed of Blastoise's charges is similar to the force of a rocket. Blastoise deliberately makes itself heavy to withstand these powerful blasts and to crush its opponents. The anime has shown that Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups of Squirtle and Wartortle. Its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Blastoise is known to sleep soundly while protected by its tough shell.[1] Blastoise has also been seen sleeping with its belly exposed on very rare occasions.

Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, Caterpie is often preyed upon by Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pok\u00e9mon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort.\nCaterpie is easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new Trainers. As Caterpie grows and develops over time, it will shed its skin many times before finally cocooning itself in thick silk. It can also spit this silk in order to entangle foes as seen in the anime. It has a voracious appetite, which drives it to eat a hundred leaves a day. It will even eat leaves bigger than itself. According to Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, its favorite food is the Vermilion flower. Caterpie lives in temperate forests and jungles.

Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.\nThe wings of Butterfree are coated with poisonous scales that easily fall off continuously as it flies. If inhaled, it results in several status conditions. It will defend Caterpie from bird Pok\u00e9mon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to fly and gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree can use its sensitive antenna to detect the odors of blooming flowers six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of nectar, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes, it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the anime.

Females will have shorter whiskers.\nIf attacked, Raticate stands up on its hind legs, bares its fangs and shrieks in an intimidating manner at its enemy. It is willing to take on larger foes if provoked enough. Its teeth are strong enough to gnaw through steel and their constant growth means it often needs to gnaw on something, like rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses, and is capable of chewing through cinderblocks and toppling concrete buildings. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Raticate is known to sleep with a log in its teeth, gnawing at it in the process. [1]. This Pok\u00e9mon typically lives in plains and savannas.\nPrior to Generation IV, Raticate and its pre-evolved form, Rattata, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Hyper Fang and Super Fang.\n"

A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs. Therefore Pikachu is a facultative biped.\nIn the anime, it has been shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicates amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. The anime has also shown that Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pok\u00e9mon species. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In the manga, it has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant. While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter.\nPikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It can release electric discharges of varying intensity. In the anime, Pikachu has been known to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications.

It has brown eyes, large, pointed ears with dark brown insides, and a triangular dark brown nose. Its paws are slightly darker than the rest of its pelt and have light brown paw pads. On top of its head are three curled locks of orange fur with bangs, and it has orange tails with curled tips. It is most commonly seen with six tails. However, Vulpix is born with only a single, white tail that splits as Vulpix grows. The tails grow hot as it approaches evolution.\nVulpix is capable of manipulating fire to such precision as to create floating wisps of flame. These wisps are sometimes mistaken for ghosts by humans, but Vulpix uses them to assist in catching prey. Inside its body is a flame that never goes out. When the temperature outside increases, it will expel flames from its mouth to prevent its body from overheating. Vulpix is known to feign injury to escape from opponents too powerful for it to defeat. Vulpix can be found most commonly in grassy plains.\n"

It has red eyes, pointed ears, and a triangular black nose.\nWhile intelligent enough to easily understand human speech, Ninetales is a very vengeful Pok\u00e9mon that has been known to curse those who mistreat it. The curse can last up to 1,000 years. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team, once a Ninetales casts its curse, it cannot be removed even by Ninetales itself. It can live for 1,000 years due to the energy within its nine tails, each of which is said to have a different mystical power. Flames spewed from its mouth can hypnotize an opponent and its gleaming red eyes are said to give it the ability to control minds. The anime has shown that it can swim while Pok\u00e9mon-Amie shows that Ninetales lick their paws to clean themselves. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Ninetales are rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grasslands.\n"

It can float by drawing extra air into its body, as demonstrated in Super Smash Bros.\nJigglypuff can use its eyes to mesmerize opponents. It has a large lung capacity, exceeding most other Pok\u00e9mon. Once it has an opponent's attention, Jigglypuff will inflate its lungs and begin to sing a soothing and mysterious lullaby. This melody can cause anyone who listens to become sleepy. If the opponent resists falling asleep, Jigglypuff will endanger its own life by continuing to sing until it runs out of air. It will continue to sing until the opponent is asleep. It can adjust the wavelength of its voice to match the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep. This helps ensure drowsiness in its opponents. Its vocal range exceeds 12 octaves, but its skill depends on the individual. Its song varies by region, and in some areas, it sounds like shouting. Jigglypuff can mostly be found in lush green plains and grassy meadows. Scream Tail shares a resemblance to Jigglypuff. It is believed Scream Tail is Jigglypuff's ancestor from 1,000,000,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Jigglypuff is known to sing even when sleeping.[3]\n"

Its large, blue eyes are covered in a layer of tears that quickly washes away any debris. It is covered in pink fur with a white belly. This fine layer of fur is so soft that those who touch it, including other Wigglytuff, will not want to stop. As a result, Wigglytuff is a highly sought-after Pok\u00e9mon because of its bouncy body and fur. It sheds seasonally, and people gather the fur to spin into yarn. It is proud of its fine and delicate fur.\nIts body is soft and rubbery, allowing it to inflate by inhaling. Wigglytuff can inflate itself up to 20 times larger, though it has no limits to how far it can inflate in total. While it is inflated, it can move by bouncing or floating. It competes with other Wigglytuff to see which one can inflate itself the most. Should it be caught in a bad mood, Wigglytuff will inflate itself to an enormous size to scare away its opponent. Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone, Wigglytuff is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in vivid green plains and grassy fields.

Due to its habitat, Zubat has evolved to have neither eyes nor nostrils. It instead navigates through dark environments and tight caves with echolocation, emitting ultrasonic cries to detect targets and obstacles. The frequency of these cries can vary slightly between Zubat colonies. As demonstrated in the anime, it will leave its abode at night with a mass of other Zubat in order to seek prey. Zubat is nocturnal, and sleeps hanging upside down during the daytime, avoiding sunlight at all costs. Daylight causes Zubat to become unhealthy, and prolonged exposure can even burn its skin. However, captured and trained Zubat have been recorded as being much more tenacious in the daytime, even when directly exposed to sunbeams.

While its mouth seems to be otherwise empty, Golbat occasionally displays a long, purple tongue. It has short legs with long, tiny feet. Despite this, Golbat can walk skillfully on the ground.\nGolbat's fangs have hollow tubes (similar to straws) specialized for sucking blood. While they are strong enough to pierce thick hide, they are also unexpectedly fragile. There are some Golbat that have missing fangs as a result of their hunger-fueled attempt to try drinking blood from Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon. Golbat feeds on the blood of both Pok\u00e9mon and humans and is capable of drinking over 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of blood in one sitting. It is gluttonous, and drinks so much blood that its blood type will change to that of its victim following a feed. It occasionally gorges itself to the extent that it becomes too heavy to fly, leaving itself vulnerable in turn. However, it is also willing to share gathered blood with other members of its kind that are hungry. One particular Golbat could utilize Supersonic to produce a magic mirror in its mouth for scrying to see things from a distance, even if walls or land are in the way.

The rounded petals of the flower are red and covered with white spots. A female Vileplume has fewer, but larger, spots on its petals. When defeated in the side series games, Vileplume's body appears to either deflate or withers while the flower remains.\nVileplume can shake, flap, or burst its petals into bloom with a bang in order to release clouds of pollen. This pollen is yellow and highly allergenic to humans, and toxic to other Pok\u00e9mon; Vileplume uses it to paralyze its prey before devouring it.

Golduck is sometimes mistaken for the Japanese monster, and the physical inspiration for Golduck, the Kappa due to its general humanoid shape, beak, and webbed hands and feet.\nGolduck is a fast swimmer, capable of out-swimming even the most athletic of humans because of its webbed appendages. Even rough seas do not hamper this Pok\u00e9mon's swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks. The TCG depicts Golduck with the ability to shoot massive jets of water form both of its hands simultaneously, using them to propel itself underwater. The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed. In the past, this Pok\u00e9mon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, Golduck has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pok\u00e9mon through telepathy. Golduck can typically be seen swimming in lakes, where it hunts fish. The prey is disabled, captured, and then brought to shore for consumption.

Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown.\nMankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, it begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated.\nAccording to the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts. However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell.

Some researchers have a theory Primeape is angry even when inside a Pok\u00e9 Ball. In some cases, Primeape has been known to die as a result of its rage, though it is also said to look peaceful in death, potentially due to its rage transcending and leaving its physical form to become something new.

Its eyes are visible in its round lower body, which is black. Extending from its lower body are two blue, beak-like appendages and numerous grayish tentacles. Its red orbs glow whenever it is excited or agitated, communicating with its own kind, and it may alert others to danger by stridently flashing them. They are also capable of refracting sunlight, storing energy, and firing ultrasonic waves.\nTentacruel's primarily light blue body helps it camouflage in the water. It has a total of 80 tentacles, which it can readily extend during hunts to ensnare its prey in a net-like shape before immobilizing it with poison. The tentacles can grow or shrink with ease. Its tentacles can absorb water to stretch even further. Most of these tentacles are hidden and kept short, leaving up to 14 exposed. However, it tends to lose tentacles as it ages. While Tentacruel are rarely seen, they can gather in large groups which scares away any nearby fish Pok\u00e9mon. Tentacruel lives in underwater rock formations and can be found throughout the ocean.\nAlthough Toedscruel bears a strong resemblance to Tentacruel, the two species are biologically unrelated.\n"

It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pok\u00e9dex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, the anime has shown that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. It has even exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrients is electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph. It has also been present in AZ's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.\nThe magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, it has been demonstrated that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. Should it run out of electricity, Magnemite will fall to the ground. Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for Magnemite to start moving again.\nMagnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Pok\u00e9tch. It has even been shown to be attracted to electric Pok\u00e9mon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Magnemite is known to sleep airbone by generating electromagnetic waves from its side magnets.[1]There are rare occasions where while Magnemite sleeps and muddles to the direction of its waves, it will loop in the the air while sleeping.\n"

Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Pok\u00e9mon Snap, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (1,000 meters). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area.\nMagneton's anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still has the need to eat. As seen in the anime, food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants. When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in The Future I Choose, it can cause interference with phone and internet signels. In An Unexpected Picnic! a herd of Magneton can produce an EMP that can destroy computor software. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph, and one was shown in a flashback to the great war of Kalos, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, Sandy Shocks bears a strong resemblance to Magneton. It is believed to be an ancient Magneton that was alive 10,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Magneton is known to sleep with its three linked Magnemite either stuck together or drifting apart by a strong magnetic force.[3]It is theoried that its magnetism is unstable while Magneton sleeps.\n"

The two heads switch turns every hour or so, with both only sleeping at the same time when they feel completely safe. Both heads have the same genes and battle together in perfect sync.\nDue to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well. However, it has developed legs that make it a powerful runner. Reaching speeds of 60 mph (100 km/h), it energetically strides across the plains leaving large 4-inch (10-centimeter) deep footprints behind it. It can better maintain balance while running by raising and lowering its two heads. Doduo lives in wide open plains, grasslands, and savannahs.\n"

        "number": "#0085",
        "biology": "Dodrio is a large, wingless, three-headed avian Pok\u00e9mon. Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black V-shaped, feather crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its head and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its tail consists of three pale red feathers with lighter tips. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs.\nEach head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of Dodrio's heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain complete control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking.\nAlong with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than Doduo, Dodrio can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Dodrio is known to usually sleep standing up.[1] Each of the three heads taking turns sleeping while one head stays awake. However, should Dodrio become very tired, even the head that remains awake may start to doze off.\n"

        "biology": "Shellder is a bivalve mollusk Pok\u00e9mon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its enormously long red tongue is used to burrow itself into the sand to sleep overnight and also to lure and capture prey. The tongue protrudes even when its shell is closed and tugging it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way.\nShellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pok\u00e9mon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar, Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths, causing the evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively.\nRegardless of which form the two Pok\u00e9mon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell.\nWhile in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pok\u00e9mon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body.\nDespite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, Shellder is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell. Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, are related to Shellos and Gastrodon. Kingler, Rufflet, and Bruxish are modern predators of Shellder.\nPrior to Generation III, Clamp was its signature move. Prior to Generation V, Icicle Spear was also its signature move, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.

It has one barb-like spike protruding from above its head, and multiple conical horns on its outer shell. Its shell is harder than a diamond with spikes that are even harder; harsh tidal currents will affect the size and sharpness of these spikes. On its pearl-like face, it has two white eyes and a mouth. Aside from its face and head, its internal anatomy has never been seen. Once it has shut itself in, it is impossible to open its shell from the outside. This impressive defense allows it to withstand anything from a bomb blast to even a missile strike.\nCloyster typically only opens its shell to attack an opponent. However, it is fully capable of retaliating against any enemy with its shell tightly closed. With rapid succession, it launches its spikes at the foe, keeping them repelled. The same projectile system it uses to launch its spikes is also used for swimming. It swallows seawater and then ejects it towards the rear, pushing it through with siphon-jet propulsion. Being the result of Shellder evolving through an Evolution stone, Cloyster is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found on the sea floor, nestled among the rocks and coral; however, it will actively hunt on land for Slowpoke tails.

Each \"head\" has a slightly different facial expression, but each face has triangular eyes with tiny black pupils and a small mouth. Each shell has some cracks, and one member of the bundle usually has its yellow insides or brain exposed. More numerous cracks are a sign that it is close to evolution. Despite looking like eggs, Exeggcute is actually more closely related to plant seeds. It is believed to carry genes of plants and other species.\nExeggcute gather in swarms of six. The heads communicate with each other by using a form of telepathy that only they can understand. Should the number of Exeggcute be reduced to less than six, the remaining Exeggcute will attempt to replace it with a similarly sized Pok\u00e9mon as seen in the anime. It needs six Exeggcute in order to stay balanced or else it becomes nervous and cowardly. Pidgeotto and Crabrawler are its natural predators, which it chases off with psychokinesis. Exeggcute inhabits jungles and forests. Exeggcute in the Alola region tend to be heavier than those from elsewhere. This is due to the shells being packed full.\nExeggcute and its evolved form, Exeggutor, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Barrage.\n"

Cubone will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When Cubone cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits \"a plaintive and mournful sound.\" On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize its mother in the full moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness. Its cries attract Mandibuzz, a natural predator.

Hitmonlee is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart.\nHitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring (and one particular Hitmonlee can do this with its arms as well). The source of its power comes from the ligaments in its legs that Hitmonlee can fully control. This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides, giving it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. Hitmonlee's kicking strength is incredibly powerful owing to its diamond-like soles. Right before kicking an opponent, Hitmonlee will harden the muscles on the sole of its foot, allowing it to maximize the full power of its kick. It has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Kick Master\". After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles. Rarely found in the wild, it is primarily found in urban areas.

Its punches are said to be as fast as a bullet train. It starts attacking foes with combo punches from both sides before finishing with a single straight punch. A single straight punch by Hitmonchan can launch foes over 300 mph. By punching with a corkscrew motion, it is even capable of drilling through concrete. Even a light graze from its punches will result in a burn. However, Hitmonchan requires a break every three minutes while fighting.

It is used for capturing prey (mainly Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon), reaching for berries, exploring its environment, attacking, and cleaning; although the effectiveness of its cleaning is questionable as its saliva leaves behind its smell. Lickitung's saliva can also be used as a strong adhesive after cooking it. Lickitung remembers things by their texture and taste, although it apparently dislikes sour things.

However, its dorsal fin is pure white and rigid.\nSeaking is a very powerful swimmer that is found in rivers and streams. It can swim not only against a river's current, but up waterfalls as well. In the autumn spawning season, it grows fatter and more vibrant. It travels upriver where male Seaking engage in elaborate dances to court females. The female would go for the Seaking with the most graceful dance.\nSeaking uses its powerful horn to bore holes in riverbed boulders in order to shelter its Eggs from water currents. A mated pair take turns patrolling around their new nest for roughly a month and defend it with their lives. There are two different groups of Trainers who are obsessed with Seaking's horns or dorsal fins. However, the groups cannot get along with each other. In Generation I, Waterfall was its signature move.\n"

        "biology": "Staryu is a golden-brown, echinoderm Pok\u00e9mon with five appendages. These appendages surround an exterior organ called the core. The core resembles a golden metal casing with a red gem in the center, which is held in place by a golden ring looped around Staryu's lower left point. If any of Staryu's appendages are lost or eaten by predators like Lumineon, it is unharmed and can grow them back with ease provided the core is still intact.\nWhen the sun goes down, Staryu's core glows its brightest. Many Staryu will float from the seafloor to the surface and align themselves with stars of the night sky as their core flickers, displaying a connection with the celestial bodies of space. The anime has shown that if Staryu becomes weak, its core will grow faint and flash slowly. During the ends of summer, groups of Staryu tend to gather while lighting up in a steady rhythm. Staryu can be found at the very bottom of the ocean on the seafloors. There are times, however, when Staryu finds itself in rivers that lead into the ocean as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Snap. In Generation III, Camouflage was its signature move.\nIn the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, and the original Japanese version of the anime episode The Water Flowers of Cerulean City, Staryu is classified as hermaphroditic.\n"

In the center of the golden casing is its red jewel core, which can glow in seven colors and has developed to resemble a cut precious stone. The second starfish is semi-attached to the back of the first and can spin 360 degrees. This rotational action is how Starmie swims through the ocean. It can also launch itself out of the water and fly through the air for short periods, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Snap.\nFrom its core, Starmie can emit electrical waves that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe. The multi-color glowing of its core is also believed to be a method of communication with other members of its species. As seen in the anime, the core will go dark if Starmie is knocked unconscious and will sometimes flicker if Starmie is low on health. Because of its body shape and habit of sending transmissions skyward, some people believe this Pok\u00e9mon to be extraterrestrial. It has been known to cause headaches on people when approached. It is rarely seen in the wild since it requires a rare evolution stone to evolve, but it can be found in the deepest parts of the ocean. It feeds by absorbing tiny plankton into its body while swimming, and it is preyed on by Lumineon.\n"

Its arms end in large, white scythes, which it uses for both hunting and fighting. Two pairs of cream-colored wings extend from its back. While these wings do allow Scyther to fly, it rarely does so. Scyther's thighs have large, upward-pointing spikes. Its feet are tall, rounded, and conical, almost extending to its thighs; each foot ends in three small, white claws on its front side.\nScyther is an adept hunter that tears at its prey with its scythes. Thanks to its green coloration, it can camouflage itself well in the grasslands and forests where it lives. Humans rarely encounter wild Scyther in these areas, however. Said to be like a ninja, Scyther can move so quickly that it cannot be followed, increasing the effectiveness of its scythes. It maintains the sharpness of its blades through battle as well as by cutting through hard objects, such as trees; it can cut down a massive tree with just a single slice, although it cannot penetrate Tarountula's elastic threads. The anime has shown that wild Scyther form swarms with a single leader chosen through combat. When a challenger successfully defeats a current leader and replaces it, the defeated leader is exiled from the swarm.

There is a large, lightning bolt-shaped stripe on Electabuzz's chest, a V-shaped stripe on its forehead, one stripe on its side, a thick stripe down its back, two bands on each leg, several broken bands on each arm, and many rings around its long tail. There are three clawed toes on each of its feet, two in front and one in back, and five fingers on each hand.\nIn the dark, Electabuzz will glow light blue from the electrical charges running across its body. It is constantly leaking more electricity than it consumes. Bearing near an Electabuzz will cause a human's hair to stand on end. Electabuzz often gathered groups around tall trees to wait for the upcoming storm. During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning to absorb the electric power. Electabuzz is often used as an alternative to lightning rods because it is unharmed by the absorption of electricity. It is also capable of entirely nonverbal communication via electrical currents when near another of its species. Blackouts have been known to happen when groups of Electabuzz gather to consume electricity from power plants, they often get blamed for the occurring power outages. As a result, Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon are kept around power plants to keep Electabuzz from raiding, although the blackouts are usually the fault of the electric companies, not Electabuzz. There is ongoing research on using Electabuzz to store away lightning until it is needed to be used later.\nAs demonstrated in the anime, Electabuzz is sent into a rage by the color red. In battle, Electabuzz windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as opponents can escape in the meantime.

Because it hates cold places, this Pok\u00e9mon typically resides in and around active volcanoes where it is born from. This Pok\u00e9mon has even been known to spit scorching flames to establish an ideally warm environment for itself. The Magmar found in Alola are said to be sturdier than Magmar found elsewhere.\nIn battle, Magmar blows out intense flames from all over its body to intimidate its foes and incinerate its surroundings. The anime has shown that extremely well-trained Magmar can block Electric-type attacks with super-heated air. However, an outmatched Magmar will quickly retreat, using its fiery camouflage and its wavering, rippling glare to blend into any present fires.

In addition to hunting prey, the anime has shown that it enjoys tree sap. Pinsir lives deep in the temperate forests and jungles, where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile. In Alola, it has a rivalry with Vikavolt and gets along with Heracross. Pinsir are known to judge each other based on their pincers.

However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle, it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species.\nMagikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability, it usually lives downstream of the water's flow. In Generation I, Splash was its signature move. It is often seen using Splash to leap out of the water, which makes it an easy target for predators such as Pidgeotto and Pidgeot. Frillish is also known to prey on Magikarp.\nIn Hoppy Town, there are at least 31 unique pattern varieties of Magikarp, with their scales coming in colors such as gray, black, white, purple, pink, violet, apricot, and brown. These patterns can be classified by groups, depending on how the Magikarp looks while it is still small; a specific pattern arises when it becomes bigger. Which patterns can be caught depend on the type of Old Rod; the better the rod, the more groups of patterns can be fished.

It is capable of launching its fur at enemies when agitated or startled; the charge is so powerful that it can remain on the shed fur for a long time. This Pok\u00e9mon is most often found in cities and towns under the ownership of Trainers. However, its high-strung nature and tendency toward mood swings can make it difficult to train.\n"

There are three small toes and a yellow paw pad on each foot. Fluffy yellow fur forms a small tuft on its head, as well as its bushy tail and a mane around its chest and neck.\nFlareon's body temperature is caused by its internal flame sac, and rises when it is excited. If its body gets too hot, it will fluff out the fur on its collar to cool down. Flareon stores and heats inhaled air in its flame sac, and then exhales it as fire with temperatures of around 3,100\u00a0\u00b0F (1,700\u00a0\u00b0C). Flareon's average body temperature is around 1,300-1,500\u00a0\u00b0F (700-800\u00a0\u00b0C), but it can reach 1,700\u00a0\u00b0F (900\u00a0\u00b0C).

In 3D games, such as Pok\u00e9mon Stadium, it can open its beak and can detach its limbs and head from its torso. According to its Pok\u00e9dex entries, it has copy protection built into its code, preventing duplication through electronic means. It was created in 1995 by Silph Co.,[1] but documents at Silph Co. claim it was created at the Pok\u00e9mon Lab on Cinnabar Island using the state-of-the-art technology of its time. Because it was created decades ago, many of its parts have since become obsolete. It was the first artificial Pok\u00e9mon to have ever been created through computer programming. In ancient Hisui, people were confused about Porygon and its evolutions due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time.\nDue to its man-made origins, Porygon does not need to breathe or eat, though it can still accept food if given. It has the ability to convert its body into digital data, allowing it to travel through cyberspace. Recently, it has become more helpful inside cyberspace by searching for any suspicious data that exists. Some believed Porygon has the power to potentially travel in space despite the species not displaying that ability yet. Because it is man-made, it is generally found in computers or in labs and other buildings where people work.\nPorygon and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Conversion and Conversion 2. Prior to Generation V, Sharpen was also one of its signature moves. Additionally, prior to Generation V, Porygon and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Download as an Ability.

Omastar swam the seas in search of prey, including prehistoric Shellder. It attacks only when prey comes near its tentacles. Omastar uses its tentacles to ensnare its prey before biting down with the deadly force of its beak. Its fangs are powerful enough to crush through rocks. With the shell broken, it would suck out the contents. Omastar was in turn preyed upon by Carracosta. Omastar is thought to be a distant ancestor to Octillery.\n"

One theory explains that Xatu can see into the future with its right eye and the past with its left, and it does not move due to fears of its visions of the future coming true. The anime has shown that it can communicate by moving its wings in a semaphore fashion. Xatu is believed to live in the forests of South America.\n"

Its head is blue, and it has black eyes. Its four feet are blue and have two digits on each foot, and it appears to be on tiptoe at all times. Its conical ears and tail have a yellow-and-black striped pattern. Mareep has an orange sphere at the end of its tail, which acts like a small light bulb. This sphere glows brighter the more electricity it has.\nMareep's wool grows continuously and stores electricity, rubbing together and building a static charge. Its volume increases when it builds up with electricity. Touching the wool when it is charged will result in a static shock. During the summer, the fleece is shed, but it grows back in a week. Air is also stored in its fur, which allows it to stay cool during summer and warm during winter. It tends to avoid battles in the wild and has a mild disposition. Mareep is most often found in grassy fields, though it can also be found in farms where its wool is used in high-quality clothing.\n"

Flaaffy's long tail has black stripes and is tipped with a blue orb.\nStoring too much electricity caused Flaaffy to lose the wool over most of its body, but the bare, rubbery skin protects it from the electricity stored in its fleece. The quality of Flaaffy's fleece can change to generate more electricity with less wool. The orb will light up when Flaaffy's mane is fully charged, and it can attack by firing electrified hairs at opponents.

In the TCG, Marill is shown to rapidly spin its tail, seemingly readying for an attack.\nMarill is able to swim in strong water currents without being slowed down by the water's resistance, due to its water-repellent fur. Marill feeds on aquatic plants in addition to fishing for food. When it dives, its tail can be seen bobbing on the water's surface. It will anchor its tail around a tree when fishing at the edge of a fast-moving stream. Marill never gets cold after swimming in cold water, due to its water-repellent fur drying up quickly the moment it leaves the water.

Sudowoodo's camouflage fails in the winter, as its forelegs remain green, unlike real trees. Sudowoodo is very weak to water and hates it, so whenever it starts to rain, it will break their disguise and flee to the nearest source of shelter.

All 26 alphabetic forms of Unown have fully open eyes, while the two punctuation forms have half-closed eyes. Though each of its forms has a counterpart in the Latin alphabet, Unown is said to resemble ancient writing and hieroglyphs. It is a mystery whether Unown predates or postdates written language, and therefore which one is based on the other. Unown can move its appendages independently like tentacles or fingers.\nThe Pok\u00e9dex and Professor Oak's research disagree on whether Unown communicates using electromagnetic waves or telepathy. Either way, it can be detected by the Pok\u00e9gear radio, which interprets it as the melody of the Azure Flute. Unown has an unknown connection to Arceus. It is said that an \"odd power\" emerges when more than one Unown come together. In Generation VIII, Hidden Power is Unown's signature move. Certain Unown loose in the Hisui region were capable of repelling Pok\u00e9 Balls that contained Pok\u00e9mon, preventing them from being battled. Professor Laventon's research observed that Unown resemble human writing from other lands, though no one took him seriously. In the anime, it is shown to be capable of reading the thoughts of other life forms. Great numbers of Unown are capable of distorting reality to suit the dreams and wishes of whoever is in control of the Unown. However, they can only do this when more Unown are present, so it could be a shared effort rather than an ability unique to each Unown.\nUnown is an extremely rare Pok\u00e9mon that lives in its own dimension and rarely ventures outside. When it moves to the Pok\u00e9mon world, Unown tends to stick to walls like engravings of ancient texts, or orbit other Unown, usually in ruins.\n"

Wobbuffet is very protective of its tail, to the point where it will suddenly turn uncharacteristically aggressive if the tail is attacked.\nWobbuffet is usually a docile Pok\u00e9mon that will never attack first. However, when it is attacked, it will inflate its body and initiate a counter-strike. When two or more of this Pok\u00e9mon meet, they will attempt to outlast each other in a battle of endurance. However, since neither is able to attack, they may compete to see which can last without food.

In addition, it has two caudal fins, the bottom of which resembling the butt of a gun and the top resembling the hammer. All of its fins except for the dorsal fin are white. It was once believed that Remoraid would not truly evolve into Octillery, due to their vastly differing appearances.\nRemoraid is well known for its ability to shoot jets of water out of its mouth with incredible accuracy and distance. It uses its abdominal muscles to do so, often to shoot down prey, such as Burmy, out of the air. The water attack can reach its prey from over 300 feet (100 meters) away, even when the prey is moving or flying. Because of this, Remoraid is referred to as the \"sniper of the seas.\" When threatened, it can also shoot water to propel itself backward.\nRemoraid tends to travel by attaching to Mantine's fins or in large groups of its own kind. It attaches itself by using its dorsal fin, which acts like a suction pad. When attached to a Mantine, it feeds on whatever the Mantine leaves behind, but will fight alongside it as well. A school of Remoraid is often seen working together and traveling with a Mantyke, helping it achieve its evolution into Mantine.

It uses its tentacles for manipulating objects and the suction cups give it strong gripping power. Because of this, it is very hard for it to be blown away.\nOctillery is a relaxed Pok\u00e9mon who loves fuss from its Trainer. Even though it is more docile when domesticated, it can be very stubborn at times in the wild. It instinctively sneaks into rocky holes or pots, and if it gets sleepy, it steals the nest of a fellow Octillery. When threatened, it will spurt ink from its mouth to cover itself before escaping, allowing it to protect itself and its young from danger. Octillery's ink obscures vision and contains substances that dull predators' sense of smell. Octillery also uses this ink on its prey, before its suction cups hold the prey tightly. Its ink can also be used as a cooking ingredient. Besides ink, Octillery sometimes uses its rock-hard head on its foes. Prior to Generation VIII, Octazooka was its signature move, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\nOctillery is normally found in oceans and caves. For a long time, people refused to believe Octillery was an evolution of Remoraid, because of the extreme physical differences between the two. It is thought to be a distant relative to Omastar.

This Galarian form of Zigzagoon is believed to be the earliest, and thus the original, instance of the species.\nMuch like the Zigzagoon found outside of Galar, Galarian Zigzagoon are known to be constantly on the move and never settling down. It is believed that Galarian Zigzagoon's restless temperament is what originated the zigzag movements observed on both forms of the species. Their known habitat stretches the entirety of Galar, being found in fields, forests, and towns. They enjoy battling to the point where they often attempt to provoke others into fighting them. While this succeeded with other Pok\u00e9mon, humans instead tend to mistake it as wanting affection, much to the Zigzagoon's frustrations.[1]\n"

It has a pointed snout, a thin stripe that dips in a V-shaped pattern between its eyes, and two whisker-like antennae on its face. Its eyes are black with green iris-like rings inside. As it is virtually blind, it uses its antennae to sense its surroundings. On its back is a pair of small, green wings. Its hind legs are white, but the forelegs are brown and have sharp claws.\nThe claws are used to carve into the roots of trees and absorb moisture and nutrients. Nincada builds underground nests at the roots of trees in tropical and temperate forests. It can occasionally live up to 10 years underground. It does not like sunlight, so it avoids it. Nincada is nearly blind due to living almost entirely underground, as such, it uses its antennae to see instead.\n"

The caudal fin is composed of two red spines with a thin yellow membrane stretched between them.\nIt has powerful jaws and razor-sharp teeth that are able to chew through solid steel, rip up boat hulls, and rip wooden boats to pieces. As a result, sailors avoid getting their boats dented by it at all costs. Carvanha has been responsible for the destruction of many boats that come into contact with it. They mercilessly swarm any intruder and prey that invades their territory, but they become timid when alone. It only attacks when in a group of five or more, becoming instantly vicious. Carvanha is drawn towards the scent of blood. It lives in rivers that course through jungles, as well as temperate regions. Each Carvanha school has its own territory. It competes with Basculin for food.\nPrior to Generation V, Carvanha and its evolved form, Sharpedo, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Rough Skin as an Ability.\n"

Its two pectoral fins are arranged so that they resemble the fins on the back of a torpedo.\nSharpedo swallows and shoots out jets of seawater from its rear, which allows it to swim 75 to 80 miles per hour. However, it is unable to swim long distances. It is feared and known by many names as Bully of the Sea, Ruffian of the Seas, Bandit of the Sea, or Gangster of the Sea as a group, due to its sharp teeth. Sharpedo uses the teeth to finish off its opponent. It was once prized for its dorsal fin as a food item and has been a victim of overfishing. Its fangs can rip through iron and steel, being able to tear apart a supertanker into pieces. Sharpedo's fangs can instantly grow back the moment it comes off. Discarded Sharpedo fangs are made into accessories due to the belief they can prevent ship mishaps. It also attacks any ships that enter the waters it lives in with no exceptions. When its fangs fall out, they grow back immediately. It is very sensitive to the scent of blood. It lives in the sea. Sharpedo is known to prey on Wailmer, particularly small ones. It also preys on other Water-type Pok\u00e9mon such as Finneon, Lumineon, Lanturn, and Squirtle. In Alola, Sharpedo is used as Ride Pok\u00e9mon called Sharpedo Jet, the natives use Sharpedo to move faster in the water and destroy rocks in the water.\nPrior to Generation V, Sharpedo and its pre-evolved form, Carvanha, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Rough Skin as an Ability.\n"

Its body color changes with water temperature, with Gorebyss found in Alola having blindingly vivid coloration. A long, purple-tipped fin extends from the top of its head, and there is a thin, pointed fin extending beneath its head. There are two purple shells on its chest, causing it to somewhat resemble a mermaid. The tail has a purple, circular fin at the tip, and two white bands near its base.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon's body is durable enough to withstand high-pressure levels in the deep sea, where it lives.

Its tail fin has a wavy outline.\nThe composition of its scales, along with its fatty body and oil-filled swim bladders, allow it to withstand the intense pressure of the ocean depths. Relicanth once had teeth, but they have long since atrophied; as such, Relicanth is a filter feeder, feeding on microscopic organisms that it sucks up with its toothless mouth. It has remained unchanged for 100 million years and stays as such because it is already a perfect life-form. It was discovered during a deep-sea expedition. Relicanth's name comes from an explorer whose name served as a variation of it.\n"

During its breeding season, it forms groups that turn the ocean's surface bright pink. As shown in Luvdisc is a Many Splendored Thing!, when two Luvdisc kiss, they are able to use their slender bodies as wings in order to fly for short periods of time. If a Luvdisc is left alone, it becomes disheartened and open to attacks from predators, such as Pelipper.\nLuvdisc is seen as symbol of love and romance; loving couples gave this Pok\u00e9mon its name after spotting it in the ocean waters. It is said that any couple who sees a Luvdisc will be blessed with eternal love, thus honeymoon hotels usually release this Pok\u00e9mon into their pools.

Frustrated at its inability to fly, it leaps off cliffs and smashes its head against large rocks indiscriminately. This process of continually bashing its head causes it to become as hard as steel. Well-developed neck muscles support its hard head. This, combined with its powerful body, allows it to shatter rocks with its head. Bagon is known to be rather solitary, preferring not to form groups with others of its kind.

While it appears to lack legs, it has a pair of thick arms with three claws on the ends. The arms are considerably thicker below the elbow and have a flat, blunt protrusion extending over the joint.\nMetang is formed when two Beldum fuse together.

However, this does not increase its intellect. This Pok\u00e9mon's high intelligence and strong magnetic field are other sources of powerful psychic energy. In addition to generating psychic power, its magnetism allows Metang to hover in midair. It is able to rotate its arms backwards in order to travel at speeds over 60 mph (100 km/h) in search of prey. When Metang finds its prey, it uses its psychic power to stop it from escaping. Then it firmly grabs onto the prey with its claws, never letting go. Metang's claws are able to rip through steel.

Its fossils show no sign of damage to its face. Shieldon is described as having a mild-mannered nature and dislikes conflict. Shieldon was revived from a Armor Fossil. In modern times, it can be found living a the Canyon Biome located in the Terarium\n"

        "biology": "Bastiodon is a Pok\u00e9mon which appears to be a cross between a ceratopsian such as Chasmosaurus and a bulldozer. Its dark gray, square head resembles a castle wall, complete with four cream-yellow, window-like spots with a black outline, three dark gray spikes on the top, and two larger gray spikes in the upper corners. Bastiodon's triangular nose extends from the middle of its shield-like head down over its lips and appears to be pierced by a gray, horizontal spike. Four spikes jut downward and four large, blunt tusks protrude upward from its dark gray lower jaw. Bastiodon's cream-yellow eyes are partially obscured by the nasal spike and spaced-out tusks. Its thick, cream-yellow body is further protected by a gray ridge and dark gray plates on its back, jagged growths on its legs, and a plated tail.\nIt is from roughly 100 million years ago. Bastiodon are known to live in herds. Despite its rough, intimidating appearance, Bastiodon is a docile, caring Pok\u00e9mon that feeds on grass and Berries. Its shield-like face is as tough as a diamond and capable of repelling any attack. When multiple Bastiodon line up side by side, their faces form a wall that nothing can break through; this was how they protected their young. In stark contrast to its impenetrable frontal defense, it is helpless when attacked from behind. It seems to have lived in the same habitats as Rampardos, as evidenced by their fossils often being found together. Because its facial bones are so hard, they were initially mistaken for its spine by researchers who found its fossils. Bastiodon has lived in the same environment as the Rampardos. Often, the duo's fossils have been found together, possibly from fighting each other to the death.\n"

Its body consists of three orange, hexagonal sections that resemble honeycomb cells, arranged with two hexagons on top and the remaining hexagon between and below them. Each hexagon has a round, yellow face with two black, oval eyes and a black, curved mouth. In the middle of their foreheads, the upper two faces each have a single whisker-thin, black antenna with black, oval tips approximately the size of their eyes. They also each have a translucent, rounded-triangle-shaped wing connected to an orange, domed joint on their sides. The backsides of the upper faces are yellow and rounded, as the sides of a sphere. The bottom face is the main thinker of the three, and it is also the only one to have a full, insectoid abdomen. This abdomen is yellow near the tip with a thick, black stripe close to its hexagonal frame. Female Combee have red, wedge-shaped spots on the foreheads of their lower faces, just below the point where all three faces meet; male Combee have no distinct markings in this area.\nSimilar to other Pok\u00e9mon with multiple heads, such as Dugtrio and Dodrio, Combee's trio of faces each have their own consciousness. For example, each face has a different taste in nectar, and Combee can fly only when the top two faces coordinate the flapping of their wings. Each Combee's trio of faces has been together since birth.\nUnlike bees in real life, the vast majority of Combee are male. However, Combee are otherwise similar to bees in their social behavior. They are mostly sociable among their own kind, and form groups of about a hundred to a thousand individuals. They are generally harmless to others, as they tend to flee when threatened. From sunrise to sunset, Combee will collect nectar to create Honey wherever they can. Beautifly often provides trouble by driving away any Combee that tries to collect near it. Though Combee produce Honey for multiple purposes, they usually consume it. Each swarm of Combee makes a different flavor of honey. When not gathering nectar, Combee will protect their queen Vespiquen. They are very suggestible and will never defy the orders of their queen. When a Vespiquen feels threatened, its Combee will not think twice about risking their lives to protect their queen, to the point of aggressively attacking or even killing the threat. Combee commonly live in caves and hollow trees of forests and other natural, secluded areas with their queen. Combee sleep by creating a hive with other Combee, locking together into a tessellated wall to feel safe in larger numbers. Teddiursa and Mothim regularly raid Combee nests for the Honey they collected.\nPrior to Generation V, Honey Gather was Combee's signature Ability.\n"

It has a yellow- and black-striped abdomen, which flares out from a thin, waist-like protrusion under its thorax in a manner that resembles an elegant ballgown. Underneath the expansive abdomen are seven orange, honeycomb-like cells that serve as a nest for baby Combee; the centermost cell, however, surrounds what appears to be a slender, yellow, more insect-like abdomen, which is often obscured by the \u2018gown\u2019 part of its abdomen. Vespiquen has black arms that each consist of two thin, conical segments. Each arm ends in two small, orange claws. It flies with a pair of relatively small wings, each of which consists of two stacked, translucent teardrop segments. Vespiquen's arms and wings attach to its round thorax, which is yellow on the front, black on the back, and orange on each side where its arms attach. A curved line on its back, between its orange shoulders, separates its thorax and waist. Vespiquen's head consists of its face and horns. Its orange face has intimidating red eyes; yellow mandibles that protrude from its face and connect to its horns; and a large, red gem on its forehead. Vespiquen's horns are yellow near its face and black at the tips, and with the gem, they resemble historical headpieces or crowns worn by European royal and noble women in the Late Middle Ages, such as the escoffion.\nSimilar to queen bees in real life, Vespiquen is a female-only species. Vespiquen is the sole queen of a hive of Combee, which it commands by releasing pheromones. The more pheromones Vespiquen produces, the more Combee it will have in its hive. As queen, Vespiquen gives birth to and raises Combee grubs, feeding on flowers to make honey for its progeny; it also controls and protects its hive. It is far more powerful than its Combee, and it will only take direct action if its Combee are unable to protect the hive; even so, the Combee will defend their Vespiquen even to the point of death. Vespiquen will destroy and feed on any outsiders it catches sneaking into its hive. However, if outsiders prove themselves to a Vespiquen by defending its hive, it may repay these acts of kindness with a reward.\nVespiquen is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Attack Order, Defend Order, and Heal Order.\n"

Its tail is almost twice as big as its body, with three spikes at the top of the curl, which it can use to shoot charges. Though its arms and legs are very short, it can run incredibly fast, enabling it to tire pursuing Pok\u00e9mon out quickly. It has a great amount of electricity flowing within its body. If it builds up enough charge, it may shock other Pok\u00e9mon. It is related to the Pikachu line.\nWhen it sleeps, Pachirisu likes to curl its big, fluffy tail round to the front of its body and uses it as a pillow. It also likes to chase and groom its tail. When a Pachirisu sheds its fur it shapes them into furballs, which have static charges just like its fur. It hides its favorite foods\u2014which mainly consist of berries\u2014in these static puffs and stores them in tree holes. It does this to protect the food; if a human or another Pok\u00e9mon tries to take the food, they will get shocked from the static.

It lives high in the treetops of tropical, temperate, and even boreal forests, using its tails for balance as it swings from branch to branch. In the Alola region, while searching for comfortable trees, Ambipom tends to get into territorial disputes with Passimian, in which they win half the time.\n"

It is also rumored that Drifloon itself is reincarnated from deceased humans.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon is known as a \"Signpost for Wandering Spirits\" due to its aimless drifting. Desiring company, Drifloon often seeks out children and grabs their hands. However, due to how light it is, it can be resisted easily and is often pulled around. This results in Drifloon running away from any children who are rough with it. Drifloon also dislikes heavy children. There are rumors that Drifloon steals children who hold onto it, guiding them to the afterlife. Despite this reputation, as seen in the anime, Drifloon can be friendly and helpful.

The attack is strong enough to hurt grown-ups and crush boulders and increases in power as Buneary trains to use it. Buneary can also use this technique to jump really high, by slamming its ears towards the ground. Buneary's arms and legs are weaker by comparison. If Buneary senses danger, it perks up both ears; conversely, if Buneary rolls both of its ears in, it is a sign that it is unhealthy. On cold nights, Buneary sleeps with its head tucked into its fur.

It is a pacifistic, quiet Pok\u00e9mon, preferring not to fight, though it will sharpen its hard, leafy tail for the occasions it needs to. The tail's sharpness is said to exceed that of a master-crafted sword, being able to cut down a large tree with one hit. Leafeon's aroma is similar to fresh grass in its youth; as it ages, this fragrance bears more of a resemblance to fallen leaves. The aroma is favored in Galar, where it is used to create a popular perfume. It lives in lush forests that have clean rivers.\nDuring the development of Generation II, the earliest iteration of Leafeon was a quadrupedal Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon with root-like feet, several markings across it's body, and a short fringe above its eyes. Its eventual redesign for Generation IV is evidenced by Leafeon's early Japanese name in the data of Pok\u00e9mon Battle Revolution matching the same name as this early iteration from Generation II, known as R\u012bfi (\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2).[1]\n"

A teal crest with two dangling flaps adorns its head, resembling hair or headgear. Glaceon has two dark blue, rhombus-shaped markings on its back; the tip of its tail, feet, and flaps are the same shade of blue.\nBy controlling its body temperature, it freezes the moisture in the air, producing ice crystals or diamond dust surrounding it. It is capable of freezing its fur into sharp needle-like icicles, which it can fire at opponents or use as protection as it tackles at its prey. It can quickly drop its body temperature below \u221275\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221260\u00a0\u00b0C). Glaceon is rather popular in ski resorts due to its ability to create powdery snow.

Its legs have two toes and a slightly darker circular coloration on the underside, and its tail has two barbs, giving its tail the resemblance of a vampire's fangs. Its arms are red with thin striations and are completely detached from its black wings, and each is ended with large pincers. Its ears have discernible, red, chambered ear insides, and its eyes are yellow. It has six visible fangs in its mouth, and its waist, like its arms, is red and striated. Gliscor's body resembles an open mouth, with the pointed protrusions coming from its upper torso resembling fangs, further illustrating its vampiric qualities. It has a tendency to hang upside down from trees while watching its prey.\nGliscor feeds on the blood of other Pok\u00e9mon species; grabbing prey using its tail, then biting their necks with its long, sharp fangs. It is even said to take pride once its prey is fully drained of blood. As shown in Riding the Winds of Change!, Gliscor, along with its unevolved form Gligar, can emit a sort of sound wave in order to detect obstacles and fly around them, similar to echolocation. Its legs appear to be not suitable for walking, so it can only perform short hops when on the ground. Gliscor hangs upside down while sleeping, much like other bat-like Pok\u00e9mon, and it is nocturnal. It is capable of soundless flight; however, its wings cannot be flapped to the same extent that other Pok\u00e9mon's wings can. Like Jumpluff and Wingull, Gliscor uses winds and updrafts to glide from place to place. When there is no wind, Gliscor climbs to the top of tall trees using its sharp raptorial claws and then glides from place to place. This practice is similar to flying squirrels. Gliscor is highly resistant against poisonous substances. It is extremely rare, but sometimes it is found in thick pine forests, swamps, and even alpine regions.\n"

The head is completely detached from the body and floats slightly above it. Its smooth, ovoid body is fuchsia with a blue ring connecting its arms. Two arms are loosely connected to their upper body and, other than their blue color, have no features. The tail is also blue and featureless but slightly resembles a paddle.\nPorygon-Z was given additional software in order to increase its abilities further, and its offensive power has greatly increased. The initial idea was to give Porygon2 the ability to travel through alien dimensions, but it did not work as planned. Instead, the resulting Pok\u00e9mon began showing highly erratic, unstable behavior and twitchy movements, making it difficult to work with for research. As a result, it is believed the experiment to create Porygon-Z was a failure. This has been attributed to the incompetence of the engineer improperly updating its programming. Academics can't seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true evolution of Porygon2. In ancient Hisui, people were confused about Porygon-Z and its evolutionary relatives due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time.\nPorygon-Z and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Conversion and Conversion 2.

Dusknoir has well-developed arms with two yellow bands near its wrists and large, gray hands. On the front of its torso are two almond-shaped markings, and on its back are two circular markings. Both sets of markings resemble eyes. A yellow band encircles its body, zigzagging along the front and forming a long curve around the back. It has a wispy tail in place of feet.\nThe antenna on Dusknoir's head allows it to receive transmissions from the spirit world, which tell it to bring people there. Dusknoir usually appears to those who are dead and bring their souls to the afterlife. Because of this, people highly fear Dusknoir.

However, the anime has shown it protecting innocent people from being taken to the spirit world. It is unknown if Dusknoir has a will of its own, or if it is forced to follow the bidding of the transmissions it receives. The band on its body can open, similar to a mouth. Dusknoir is capable of using its belly mouth to swallow its target whole. It also uses this ability to take spirits into its body and carry them home or as it travels to unknown places.

The striated pattern has similar recurrences on the underside of its mane, tail, and face. Its four pointed feet are tipped with gold hooves. Its long mane juts away from its head, and its face is gray, with green eyes and red pupils, and a green circular pattern below its eyes. Arceus also has a streak of gold coloration on its head and ears that point upward. Its neck is fairly long, with two pairs of extrusions to the sides, and a flap-like feature on the neck's underside that is colored white like much of the body. Arceus also has a golden cross-like wheel attached to its body by its round abdomen, which changes color along with its eyes and hooves based on its current type, which depends on the Plate or type-specific Z-Crystal that it wields. The wheel also has four jewels attached to it. The pattern of striated gray of Arceus's underbelly resumes past Arceus's waist. Its limbs have gray undersides and extrusions at the tops of the legs. Arceus's tail is fairly like its mane in terms of shape and coloration. Despite its quadruped appearance, Arceus is capable of flight.\nAccording to legend, it shaped the Pok\u00e9mon universe using its 1,000 arms. Arceus has been referred to as \"The Original One\" in myths and legends and is generally considered to be one of the strongest Pok\u00e9mon. Arceus is thought to have created Sinnoh and Ransei, and possibly the entire Pok\u00e9mon universe, along with the lake guardians, Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit, as well as the Pok\u00e9mon of Myth, Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. Because of this, Arceus is thought to be one of the most long-lived of all Pok\u00e9mon species. It has the power to recreate the Pok\u00e9mon of Myth as well, presumably to guard the dimensions when a Trainer has caught one of them. In Arceus and the Jewel of Life, Arceus has been portrayed as having powers such as bringing back things that it once destroyed, making certain things vanish into thin air, halting time, and overturning the very laws of nature. As depicted in Showdown at the Gates of Warp!, Arceus has the power to not only calm Dialga and Palkia but also destroy the Red Chain. Arceus can change its type at will in order to adapt to a situation, as seen with its use of Plates (including the Legend Plate) or Z-Crystals. Arceus also has the power to split up into two, creating a piece of itself to exist outside of its home dimension which is also implied to be its physical form, being only a piece of its whole being, while its true form is unknown and incomprehensible.\nArceus is shown to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times and protected it from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion in return to those who treated it with equal kindness. In the modern time, Arceus continues to watch over the world, and it wishes for people and Pok\u00e9mon to work together in the face of adversity. Even when it is needed, it would only give out hints for how to solve the problem, instead of directly interfering. In Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, it is explained that Arceus can give its blessing to Pok\u00e9mon to make them more powerful, which are referred to as noble Pok\u00e9mon and Ride Pok\u00e9mon, and the power is passed down through family lines. The people of Hisui worshipped the noble Pok\u00e9mon. Arceus can also create items for humans to use, such as the Arc Phone. Arceus does not suffer fools gladly, and it will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived. It also holds long grudges if betrayed by those it considered friends. In Arceus and the Jewel of Life, it is said to \"feed\" off the energy of the elemental plates. Arceus has the power to appear in dreams and create a variety of Pok\u00e9mon to serve as challenges as seen in Eternal Battle Reverie.\nIn the introduction sequence of Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, Arceus was capable of taking a large, golden, glowing, silhouette-like form while in its homeworld, it was shown to be capable of human speech, and it also states that Arceus is simply the name humans call it. The first ancient inhabitants of the Hisui region, the Celestica, worshiped it, referring to it as \"almighty Sinnoh\" and \"great Sinnoh\". Arceus also had the title \"might of Sinnoh\", with the term Sinnoh later on becoming the name of the region. The Diamond Clan and Pearl Clan also worship it, though they mistook Dialga and Palkia, respectively, for Arceus. In Alola, Arceus was used as base by the Aether Foundation to create an artificial Pok\u00e9mon named Type: Full, with an Ability similar to Arceus's. However, the project was deemed a failure and was later abandoned.\nArceus is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Judgment, which is capable of disintegrating the landscape around it.

Its body is mostly light brown with the exception of black stripes crossing over and under its legs and its pink underbelly. It has a black stripe on its snout in front of its eyes, and black covering the tip of its tail. Its eyes resemble shaded binoculars and are shrouded in a black membrane all around their front. This membrane prevents sand from getting in Sandile's eyes and helps it see in the harsh desert sun. Its long snout is tipped by two protruding nostrils, and its mouth comprises the bottom half. Its feet are flat and contain three sharp, black claws. They are attached to stubby legs on its sides.\nSandile is only found in deserts, with the exception of Alola, where the warm environment is comfortable enough for them to appear elsewhere. It usually burrows under the surface of the sand, with only its nose and eyes appearing above ground. Due to being so close to the surface, it can move around the desert and allow the heat of the sand to regulate its body temperature. This also serves as a way of hiding from enemies. Its movement through sand has been described as being similar to swimming. When the sun sets, it burrows deep into the sand to sleep until sunrise. As seen in the anime, in the wild, Sandile can be mischievous and potentially troublesome to humans. However, Sandile will protect another of its species, and can be caring at times. Sandile is an ambush predator, hiding under the sand and waiting for unwary prey, such as Trapinch, to walk over it before it bites on their legs. However, Sandile is not very skilled at hunting prey, thus it also mostly eats anything that collapses in the desert; hence it has been known as \"the cleaner of the desert.\"\n"

It has six thick, black stripes on its body: one at shoulder level, one around its midsection, one around its hips, and three on its tail. Each stripe is topped with a triangular spike on its back. The stripes around its midsection cross two spikes, one on each side of its back. Its arms are short and thin, with a black band around them at the elbow. Each hand contains three short fingers, each with a white claw. Its legs are thick with a band around each ankle, and a stripe above the knee that does not wrap around. Its flat feet each have three white claws. Krokorok's head is ovoid with a long snout, and small eyes surrounded by a thick black membrane. Two of its front and rear teeth are visible overlapping its lower jaw. A black stripe sits on the bridge of the snout just behind its large nostrils.\nKrokorok prefers to live in the desert, usually in small groups. The black membrane surrounding its eyes protects them from sandstorms and acts as a thermal detector. This allows Krokorok to see the temperature of different objects, which also gives it exceptional night vision. This enables it to hunt in the dead of night without getting lost. However, it never moves much during the night. A group of Krokorok usually consists of a few individuals. The group is led by a female Krokorok while the males gather food. Krokorok dislikes feeling cold, so it burrows into the desert sand at night. It tends to bury its prey in the sand to preserve them in the event of an unsuccessful hunt.\n"

All of the smaller spikes on its back are linked to black, triangular spikes that reach around to its front, slightly overlapping its white stomach. The largest spike sits at the beginning of its long thick tail, which has three, thick, black stripes. The last stripe covers the tip of the tail. Its legs are very short and directly attached to its feet. The feet are wrapped in black and have three white claws facing forward. Krookodile's arms are short and thin with a black stripe around the elbow. Its long, thin fingers are each tipped with a white claw.\nIts head is slightly pointed and contains a distinctive black membrane that surrounds both eyes. The outline of the membrane angles upward sharply, coming to points above the top of Krookodile's head. It uses this distinctive look to harshly intimidate opponents. Its eyes are very powerful, with variable focus, allowing it to see things at a great distance, even in the middle of a desert. Its other notable feature is its long snout, containing a black stripe around the bridge, and large pointed nostrils on the end. Four of its rear and two of its front teeth slightly overlap its lower jaw. Krookodile's jaws are extremely powerful, giving it the ability to crush objects as large and durable as an automobile. The jaws can twist a body before breaking it in half. These features are topped by Krookodile's extremely violent temper. It has been known to clamp down on any moving object and will do everything it can to make sure its prey cannot escape. Krookodile coexists well with Flygon in searching for food, hiding in the sandstorms that Flygon creates as they hunt, then splitting the prey that they manage to catch.\nKrookodile has been known as the \"Bully of the Sands\". It uses the sandy terrain as cover to patiently wait for prey to pass by, even throughout the day without rest. Krookodile can swim through the desert sands as if they were water. Not even a thick metal plate is able to withstand a Krookodile's strong jaw bite.\nPrior to Generation VIII, Power Trip was its signature move, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\n"

If Inkay is threatened, the blinking lights will cause its opponents to become dazed and lose their will to battle, allowing it to escape. The blinking also serves to attract Inkay's prey, which is then ensnared and held in place by its tentacles. Inkay also uses various complex rhythms and patterns of lights to communicate to others of its kind. Because of this, Inkay instinctively reacts to anything in its habitat that emits light or echoing sounds. By floating upside-down, Inkay improves its blood flow along with clearing its head.

Extending from the top of its head is a horn that resembles an old-fashioned key with two wide, blunt teeth. Extending from either side of the key is a thin loop that surrounds Klefki. Hanging from the loop are various keys that this Pok\u00e9mon has collected. As seen in the TCG, the loop is highly mobile and can split both at the top and the bottom, allowing Klefki to collect new keys and even express its feelings. Klefki is very tiny, tying with Alolan Diglett and Meltan as the shortest Steel-type.\nKlefki are known to be very even-tempered. In the past, Klefki inhabited mines. When the minerals on which it fed became scarce, it moved on to human settlements. It now feeds on metal ions by inserting its key-like horn into chinks in metal. It likes to collect keys, particularly master keys, and will sneak into people's homes to steal them. It collects keys to feed on their metal ions, as well as to threaten predators by rattling its collection at them. It is said that Klefki's key-like appearance is the result of an adaptation to suit its habit of collecting keys. Although it feeds on keys, it will never release a key it likes, holding onto to it for decades, so people will give it important keys as a way to prevent theft. However, on rare occasions, it will discard a key without second thought. In the past, nobles kept Klefki for generations, taking great care of them while entrusting them with important vault keys.\nKlefki is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fairy Lock.

Each cannon is separated into three segments by bright blue lines and each segment has a single blue dot and a short, blunt growth. The topmost segments also have four small, yellow bumps around the ends.\nVolcanion has an organ that allows it to vaporize the water it absorbs instantly with extremely high temperatures. The arms on Volcanion's back expel the resulting steam from inside its body, allowing it to disappear into the dense fog. It can expel steam of superbly high pressure and has the ability to blow away mountains. Volcanism is capable of creating explosive shockwaves[1].

Its large eyes contain dark irises and usually appear closed. It also has a stubby beak with a white upper jaw and an orange-brown lower jaw, and a few short tufts of feathers on the back of its head. Two green leaves curve around its face, resembling an asymmetric cut; the leaf on its right is longer than the one on the left. Under its chin are two smaller leaves that resemble a bowtie, and there are two pointed ones on its rear that form its tail. Its wings have two tan spots on the upper side and leafy plumage close to the body on the underside. Within the leaves under its wings are two sharp orange-brown feathers known as blade quills. Dartrix has orange-brown talons with two toes facing forward and one facing backward.\nThis alert Pok\u00e9mon is sensitive to the presence of others around it, and is capable of launching attacks on unseen enemies behind it. It propels its blade quills at enemies or prey with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. However, it can occasionally miss hitting at times. Dartrix is narcissistic by nature, spending a lot of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen. It has been described as a bit of a birdbrain as it has a tendency to make mistakes; when it does, it sometimes tries to cover it up, which ends up making the situation worse. A Trainer who helps Dartrix through this difficult stage of its life will allow it to reach its full strength.[1] Conversely, Dartrix will refuse to listen to a Trainer who doesn't diligently help it groom.\nIn Hisui, Dartrix tends to expose itself to sunlight in order to gain power, presumably due to the region's cold climate. As a result of the harsh environment, Dartrix becomes more sturdy when it evolves into Hisuian Decidueye, gaining the Fighting type instead of the Ghost type.\nDartrix and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have the Ability Long Reach.\n"

It has a short snout with a pink nose, a large mouth full of pointed teeth, eyes nearly hidden under its yellow stripe, and tufts of yellow fur on its chin. There are three black claws on each of its four short legs. Despite its length, Gumshoos is thick-bodied and has a wide, flat tail with longer fur on the tip.\nGumshoos hunts by patiently waiting along its prey's known travel routes and pouncing when the unsuspecting prey comes along. Due to its tenacious personality and ability to withstand intense hunger, it is able to wait for its prey for long periods without eating.[1] Its favorite prey are Rattata and Raticate, but since Gumshoos is diurnal, it rarely encounters them. It is also known to prey on Skwovet. Once the sun sets, this Pok\u00e9mon's stamina is depleted and it will fall asleep where it stands. It is not originally from Alola, and was brought over to take care of Rattata outbreaks. Prior to Generation VIII, Gumshoos and its pre-evolved form, Yungoos, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Stakeout as an Ability.\nA special Gumshoos in Alola serves as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for the Verdant Cavern's Island trial.\n"

It has large, black eyes with white pupils.\nGrubbin typically lives underground. It uses its jaw as a weapon, a tool for burrowing, and for extracting sap from trees. Additionally, it can create sticky threads, which it shoots from its mouth and uses to swing around as though on suspension wires. It also uses these threads to stop opponents from moving, so it can then grab them in its mandibles, which are strong enough to snap thick tree branches. Even its natural enemies, such as Rookidee and Hoothoot, would rather run away than risk getting caught in its mandibles. It loves electricity and can be found near power plants.

Two short, yellow spikes extend from the front square: one on each side of its rectangular mouth. The mouth itself is gray and has two jaws that close sideways, shaped like a lightning bolt when open.\nCharjabug is often found half-buried in earth or leaves, munching on large quantities of humus. The sturdy shell covering Charjabug's body protects it from attacks, allowing it to eat peacefully. This diet helps Charjabug evolve into Vikavolt. In its body is an electric sac, which it uses to store electricity generated by digesting food. The electricity it stores could run a household for a whole day and can be shared with other Pok\u00e9mon.[1] People on camping trips are grateful to have a Charjabug around. It can discharge electricity from the tips of its jaws to attack especially persistent opponents. Charjabug will zap anyone who accidentally steps on it. As shown in the anime, it can send sound waves to communicate with nearby Grubbin. Vikavolt is known to clasp Charjabug in between its legs and use it as a battery to enhance its Electric-type moves, unless it is in an aerial battle.\nCharjabug is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Battery as an Ability.\n\n"

Its body is black and divided into three sections by yellow rings. The last two sections have a yellow spot on each side. On its back is a pair of wide, flat wings that are transparent with blue elytra. It has four legs; the front pair of legs has two claws, while the back pair has only one.\nVikavolt produces electricity with an organ in its abdomen and controls it with its huge jaws to fire powerful electromagnetic beams. Vikavolt shoots these to strike down bird Pok\u00e9mon. When it clasps a Charjabug in its legs, it is able to utilize it as an extra battery. This allows it to rapidly fire its powerful beam attacks. However, during fierce aerial fights, it will release Charjabug to make itself lighter and more mobile. It is an adept flier, capable of acrobatic maneuvers such as tailspins and sharp turns. Even as it weaves through complicated tangles of branches in the forest, it is able to maintain high-speed flight.[1] It is known to have a rivalry with Pinsir and Heracross. As shown in the episode A High-Speed Awakening!, it likes to drink tree sap. In that same episode, it is shown that, in Alola, there is a competition known as the Vikavolt race, where Trainers can have their Vikavolt race for the chance to win a Buginium Z.\nA special Vikavolt in Alola serves as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for the Hokulani Observatory's Island trial.\n"

There is a small amount of meat in its claws, which is considered delicious.\nA competitive Pok\u00e9mon that hates to lose, this Pok\u00e9mon uses its large claws to protect its face and belly while it closes in on opponents. Crabrawler's pincers sometimes break off from overuse but grow back quickly. Crabrawler's pincers are a popular ingredient for paella, making a tasty soup stock. Crabrawler strives to achieve not only a high social standing but a physically higher position as well. It can be found clinging to buildings or even tall people and will punch anyone who attempts to remove it from its perch. In the event that it does lose, its mouth will foam before it faints.\nWhile it is capable of splitting tree trunks, it usually punches trees to knock down ripe berries. Many Crabrawler will gather around a tree to compete for the ripe berries. [1] Crabrawler also preys on Exeggcute.

On top of its head is a patch of yellow fur with two tufts extending upward. Its face has white eyes with slanted black pupils, and a large mouth where two blunt teeth are visible. Below its mouth is a dumbbell-shaped protrusion; together with its abdomen, they create the impression of pectoral and abdominal muscles. Its arms are segmented into three parts. The arm segments grow in size with the smallest being closest to the body. Its claws have a dark blue pawprint-shaped marking on the tips which create Bigfoot prints on snow. The mark that would be the \"palm\" of the paw is actually the lower half of the claw. Its four legs are short, with pointed tips that are freezing to the touch, as shown in Pok\u00e9mon Refresh.\nCrabominable grew its fluffy fur to combat the icy cold of its mountain home. It can also store cold in its claws, which are capable of smashing ice walls or halting avalanches. In desperate times, the claws can even be fired like rockets. Additionally, Crabominable can freeze its opponents in place by firing icy bubbles from its mouth, which is useful since Crabominable has a slow movement speed. Crabominable's detached pincers are said to have a delicious taste; some Trainers have been known to use Lechonk just to find these pincers.\nPrior to Generation IX, Crabominable was the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Ice Hammer.\n"

All of the tentacles reach the ground, except for the one directly in front, which is shorter and leaves its face exposed. The tentacles are light blue and covered in purple spines. On top of its head is a purple area with a collection of spikes with a larger, yellow spine in the center.\nMareanie is able to regenerate any body part overnight, except its head. The lost limbs have a very bitter, astringent flavor, and thus they cannot be eaten as food. Bruxish feeds on Mareanie, which in turn eats the branches of Corsola \u2014 except in Galar, where it has not yet learned to prey on them. Mareanie also eats broken-off Pincurchin spines, despite the risk of getting electrocuted. It uses the spike on top of its head to poison its prey and uses its tentacles to either trap its prey or deal the final blow. In the anime, it has also been seen attaching itself with all of its tentacles and releasing poison through its spines. The poison causes numbness and intense itching.

The inner spines are purplish pink, and when they are present, the outer spines sink back into its legs, and vice versa. The tip of each legs has two orange claws, and there is a ring of orange spines around a purplish-pink marking where all the legs meet on top.\nToxapex uses its legs to walk along the ocean floor, where it hunts for Corsola. They can also be used to create a dome-like shelter, protecting it from the tides and, in colder regions, trapping its body heat to keep it warm. Toxapex's spines sense the flow of tides, allowing it to survey its surroundings. Its spines can also be fired at enemies and carry a powerful poison, which causes pain for 72 hours (3 days), even to Pok\u00e9mon as large as Wailord.

It then regurgitated the mud in order to cover itself in it. Mudbray's mud won't dry out, even when exposed to the sun for long periods of time. Denying it this will cause it to become stressed and disobey its Trainer. This Pok\u00e9mon boasts immense strength for its size and is able to drag or carry loads up to 50 times its own weight. Mudbray are known to be skilled at using mud. The mud that collects around its hooves enhances its grip and power. Notably, it allows Mudbray to travel rough terrains without slipping. Because it was hunted nearly to extinction when it lived all over the world, it was believed for a time to run wild only in Alola.[1] Despite this, Mudbray have been seen roaming in Galar and Paldea, suggesting that its population is slowly recovering from near extinction.

Regardless of the trouble it is in, it will never cry out and will defeat opponents with a single blow.[1] The mud around its legs gives its kicks extra force; one kick can turn a car or large truck into a scrap pile. When galloping, its hooves can dig holes in asphalt. While it is not swift, it has excellent stamina and can continue on for three days and three nights while dragging over 10 tons. It will mix dirt and saliva to create a special mud with resistance to both wind and water. The mud is also harder than even stone. Because of its unique qualities, the walls of some old houses were coated with Mudsdale's mud. Mudsdale is highly treasured for both physical labor and pottery made from its high-quality mud.

It will not stay in the same spot for more than a day due to the danger involved. If anything bothers it while it is gathering sunlight, Fomantis will fiercely attack it. The reason is that Fomantis hates its naps being disturbed. When regularly exposed to sunlight, it grows up with vivid coloration. Though it excels at long-range attacks, it will rarely use those that require it to use its stored photosynthetic energy.[1] Fomantis can give off a sweet and refreshing scent.

There are several leaves stuck on its body with saliva. The shoulders and chest all have one vertical and one horizontal leaf. While most Passimian have green leaves, the anime has shown that there is a red leaf variant on Akala Island that has one additional horizontal leaf in each area. The leaves' color and position are decided by the leader of a troop and aid in distinguishing one troop from another.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon creates troops of 20 to 30 members.

The helmet has a large jaw piece that wraps around the front with large, round hinges on the side. Each hinge is covered by a green X-shaped marking. The name of the Pok\u00e9mon, as it wears the helmet, is called Null meaning nothing.[1] Small gray eyes can be seen from within rectangular black holes on the front, and there are two pointed ears on the top. Around the base is a collar with four protruding vanes that are tipped with a three-way spike. This collar has a thin green line between the vanes, and each vane has a green hexagon near the end. An axe-like blade with a band around the middle extends backward from the top of the helmet. The front tip of the blade has a small, silver spike that hooks downward.\nA mane of gray fur hangs from below Type: Null's helmet and covers its shoulders and chest.

Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a light blue fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes.\nType: Null was created by the Aether Foundation as part of the beast killer project. It was designed to be an \"Anti-UB Fighting life-form\", a weapon created to fight against the Ultra Beasts. Also known as \"beast killer\", Type: Null was developed with cells taken from all known Pok\u00e9mon types. This was done with the intention of giving it the ability to shift between types by holding a corresponding memory, an ability originally inspired by the myths researched at Canalave Library. This ability led the Aether Foundation to name it \"Type: Full\". Three known models of Type: Full were created, but all three rejected the RKS System and went berserk. Faba had created limiter helmets for these Pok\u00e9mon, and after being subdued, the three Type: Full were given the helmets to lessen the effects of the RKS System's rejection and were put into permanent cryogenic stasis. Thus, the beast killer project was deemed a failure, and the creature's name changed to Type: Null. At some point before the events of Generation VII, Gladion was able to free one of the Type: Null, which he adopted as his own in the hopes of finding a way to undo the effects of the limiter helmet and allow it to use the RKS System. Gladion would eventually rediscover its evolution, Type: Full, renaming it as Silvally. When Type: Null evolves into Silvally, it breaks the helmet it wears in the process.\nIn Generation VIII, a new Type: Null surfaces in the Galar region, apparently created by Macro Cosmos by utilizing research notes stolen from Alola.\n"

Its fins are all dark purple, light blue, or a combination of the two colors: the pectoral fins are mostly dark purple with a short line blue line along the bottom, the dorsal fin is light blue, the ventral fin is dark purple, and the tail fin is dark purple with a light blue, heart-shaped marking in the middle. On top of its head is a protuberance with a dark purple bulb at the tip. The bulb is able to open like a flower, which reveals a light blue orb in the center.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon buries itself on the seafloor, leaving only the growth on its head exposed. By emitting a low level of psychic power, it serves as a radar to detect prey. Additionally, the protuberance can emit a strong psychic power. Opponents bathed in this power are stricken with terrible headaches and fall unconscious.[1] Prey, which includes Shellder and Mareanie, are ground into mush and eaten. Toxapex is a rival of Bruxish in warm ocean currents.\nWhen emitting psychic power, Bruxish grinds its teeth, which stimulates its brain and creates psychic energy. This sound is enough to send nearby Pok\u00e9mon fleeing immediately. In the Alola region, lifeguards allow this Pok\u00e9mon to remain in their area to prevent other, dangerous Water Pok\u00e9mon from gathering.[1] Any sunlight reflecting on Bruxish's ripples will cause the water to shine brightly.\nBruxish is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Dazzling as an Ability.

Its eight tentacles become long and flattened and have numerous deep black spots with various colored diamond-shapes inside. Four of the tentacles are connected to the bell via frilly white structures; these tentacles have four spines protruding from them that can be used similarly to hands. The remaining four tentacles each terminate in a single larger spine that, as depicted in 10,000,000 Reasons to Fight!, injects its toxins into the ground while sharp rocks grow below.

This can leave the former host to remain ill for unspecified amounts of time and treatment may be necessary. Nihilego leaving a host's body can also cause unconsciousness, as is the case with Lusamine, however it unknown whether or not this is because of Nihilego's toxins, the stress of fusion or the overwhelming amount of Z-Power within her body.\n\n"

Around its neck is a smoky collar, and there is a trail of shadows on each foot.\nWhen angered or attacking, such as while using its exclusive Z-Move, Marshadow's fighting spirit will begin to burn[1], causing it to become Zenith Marshadow[2]. In this state, its headgear, wrist bumps, and collar flare up and resemble green and yellow flames. Marshadow's eyes also flare up when in this state, but do not change in color.\nVery few people have seen it, so its existence has been the stuff of legends and myths. A cautious Pok\u00e9mon, Marshadow sinks into the shadows to ensure it is not noticed while it observes its surroundings, much like how Gengar can. While hiding in the shadows of others, it can understand their feelings and copy their abilities. Through mimicry, it will eventually become more powerful than those it imitates. It can even learn the ultimate technique of martial arts masters it copies. As seen in the anime, Marshadow is also capable of causing nightmares.\nMarshadow is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Spectral Thief.

It has white fins connected to its fish head.\nIt has trouble eating due to its mouth being on top of its head, even though it captures prey by freezing its surroundings. The skin on Arctovish's face is impervious to attacks. It allegedly became extinct despite this due to breathing difficulties, though this is likely not the case due to Arctovish being combined from two separate Pok\u00e9mon that each had their niches before going extinct.\n"

Duraludon's head has a small red section and multiple slits on it. It also has yellow eyes with green pupils, and it appears to be permanently scowling. It moves its upper jaw when opening its mouth. Duraludon armor has a smooth feel, similar to a mirror finish.\nDuraludon's body is made of strong, but surprisingly light, special metal. The armor is both durable and resistant to scratches. Weighing only 88\u00a0lbs. (40\u00a0kg), it can move very fast. However, its body can easily rust, so it lives in caves and mountainous areas and avoids rain. The metal body also has a risk of overheating, so it vents the heat out through the slits inside its tail. It uses its arms, which have slightly different shapes from each other, to grind down rock surfaces for food. Duraludon has a rivalry with Tyranitar, which it shares its habitat with, and they often battle each other in the mountains of Galar.[1] It mainly resides in caves and mountains within cold areas.\nDuraludon and its evolved form, Archaludon, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Stalwart as an Ability.\n"

        "biology": "Eternatus is a gigantic, draconic alien Pok\u00e9mon. Its body has a vaguely draconic shape and a skeletal appearance and is largely dark violet with red highlights. Its main body and tail are long and thin, and resemble a spinal column, and it has four small, thin limbs ending in claws formed from spindly appendages attached at right angles. Its torso is formed from a cage of appendages resembling ribs, and inside is a glowing pink core that serves as Eternatus's energy source, absorbing energy to sustain it. Its head is triangular and has a pair of white, eye-like markings in the form of three connected circles, as well as a spindly lower jaw with several diamond-shaped teeth. Over its head is a translucent red film held between five long spikes extending toward its body's rear. It also has a pair of thin tendrils extending from its back, formed from numerous triangular segments. Eternatus's gigantic size makes it the tallest known Pok\u00e9mon with the exception of Dynamax and Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon.\nEternatus serves as the source of the Dynamax and Gigantamax phenomena in Galar due to its power leaking out in the form of Galar particles following its defeat thousands of years ago by Zacian, Zamazenta, and the two young heroes. After it reawakened in the present day, Eternatus's core needed to absorb the Galar particles from the lands of the Galar Region, said energy being necessary for Eternatus to stay active apparently due to its past defeat weakening it. In Pok\u00e9mon Masters EX Eternatus is shown to be able to replace Galar particles by absorbing sync stone energy instead, but in a much greater amount. Its core can also project its absorbed energy into massive blasts fired directly from it and capable of causing more damage to Dynamaxed and Gigantamaxed Pok\u00e9mon. Pieces of its body imbued with its power rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars. When it is awake, Eternatus causes a phenomenon dubbed the Darkest Day, in which the massive quantities of Dynamax energy it unleashes cause Pok\u00e9mon to Dynamax and rampage uncontrollably. It can also sometimes keep other Pok\u00e9mon from Dynamaxing in its presence. Despite this connection to the phenomenon, it cannot be Dynamaxed itself, as its Eternamax form replaces that effect.\nAs seen in the anime, Eternatus can use its energy core to target a Pok\u00e9mon and force it to Dynamax or Gigantamax. The anime also elaborates upon its ability to block other Pok\u00e9mon from Dynamaxing, depicting this power as Eternatus absorbing the Galar particles in the area to make them unavailable for other Pok\u00e9mon to use. It is also shown to be capable of forcibly reverting other Pok\u00e9mon that have already Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed through the same process. As seen in chapter PASS30 of the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, its poison also has the capability of changing someone's behavior, making them violent and selfish, as shown with Henry after he touched some of Eternatus's poison. As later mentioned by Calyrex in PASS38, both met during the first Darkest Day. In the anime, Rose coined Eternatus's name, but in the past, it was known as the \"Darkest Day\", as referred by the people of Galar who feared it 3000 years ago.\nEternatus is an extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon that came to Earth inside an asteroid around 20,000 years ago. It's implied by Peonia that Eternatus's asteroid (referred as a Wishing Star) landed at the Crown Tundra, specifically in Slippery Slope, creating a huge cavern that'd be, in the future named, the Max Lair.\nEternatus is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Dynamax Cannon and Eternabeam.\n"

All forms also have a white throat sac, which resembles a bed of rice when inflated; Tatsugiri inflates its throat sac to camouflage itself. The major difference between each form of Tatsugiri is its colors and the poses it makes. Curly Form Tatsugiri is orange with darker orange splotches all over its body and a white underbelly, and it often assumes an upcurled stance. Droopy Form Tatsugiri is mostly a pinkish-red, with white colorations on its belly and fins; true to its name, it tends to droop on its throat sac. Stretchy Form Tatsugiri is a solid yellow, except for its white throat sac; it assumes a straight, horizontal pose. It is said that Tatsugiri's various forms are an adaptation to suit the preferences of its prey.\nAlthough relatively weak, Tatsugiri is one of the most intelligent dragon Pok\u00e9mon. It baits prey such as bird Pok\u00e9mon by playing dead. When its prey approaches, Tatsugiri then commands its partner, Dondozo, to attack. The Dondozo follows the orders of its Tatsugiri partner loyally, and provides the Tatsugiri protection and shelter with its large mouth, in exchange for a greater chance at catching prey.\nTatsugiri is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Commander as an Ability.\nA giant Tatsugiri, together with a giant Dondozo, are both known as the False Dragon Titan, one of the Titan Pok\u00e9mon found in the Paldea region.\n"

The chawan it inhabits is black and white, with a few cracks sealed with green all over it, and a swirling, face-like pattern on its side. Atop its head, Sinistcha wears a \u8336\u7b45 chasen (a bamboo whisk used to prepare and stir matcha tea)[1], which is broken and missing a few of its teeth. Despite appearances, Sinistcha is not biologically related to Polteageist.\nSinistcha lives in cool, dark areas such as the back of a shelf or beneath a house's floorboards. In the past, Sinistcha would sneak into houses and pretend to be tea in order to trick people into drinking it, so it can absorb their life force. However, because the chawan Sinistcha inhabits had fallen out of use, this act became largely unsuccessful. In recent times, instead of sneaking into houses, Sinistcha roams towns and suburbs in search of prey. It is generally active after sunset, and will attack anything that approaches it with a life-force-draining splash of tea. In order to prepare itself for battle, Sinistcha builds up its energy by using the chasen on its head to stir itself.[1]\nSinistcha is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Matcha Gotcha. Additionally, Sinistcha and its pre-evolved form, Poltchageist, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Hospitality as an Ability.\n"

This position allows for less mobility but offers Archaludon a sturdier center of gravity. In this position, Archaludon is capable of using the static electricity stored in its terminals to fire a tremendously powerful beam of electric energy.[1] When Archaludon charges up to fire this beam, electrical energy connects the terminals on its head, tail, and limbs, in a similar fashion to bridge suspension cables. During storms and other inclement weather, Archaludon's terminals can gather static electricity more easily, allowing it to fire off its beam much faster.[1] Archaludon's defensive capabilities are so strong that it cannot be fazed by a cave-in.

        "biology": "Iron Crown is an armored turquoise Pok\u00e9mon resembling a robotic goat. The eyes are bright digital blue. The top of its luminous head has two yellow metal horns similar in shape to drills, with luminous patches that extend from the upper half of the horn. The horns can create two long bright blue blades that can extend before bending at the end. The metal snout is gray, and there is a luminous blaze running from its nose to the back of its head. The back of the head has a headpiece with a circle connected by two rectangle pieces. On its long neck and hind legs, there are small luminous spots. It has several other luminous patches on its body, emitting a faint blue aura. Iron Crown's face, parts of its neck, and underside are grey. The grey parts of its body have several dark grey lines connecting to different parts. On its shoulder blades are yellow metal protrusions that resemble fins. Iron Crown's legs are connected by four-leg armor parts. The lower legs have a luminous v-shape brand connecting to light armor and metal hooves.\nDiscovered in Area Zero, it is unknown what kind of Pok\u00e9mon Iron Crown actually is.[3] It resembles a mysterious object introduced in Occulture as a cutting-edge weapon shaped like a Cobalion. There was supposedly an incident in which it launched shining blades from its distinctive horns to mow down everything around it to pieces, though little else is known about it.[4] Iron Crown is capable of rotating its head.\nAccording to AI Turo, Iron Crown is a future Pok\u00e9mon related to Cobalion. However, according to a Turo brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Iron Crown is a counterpart of Cobalion from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown.

        "biology": "In its Normal Form, Terapagos is a small reptilian Pok\u00e9mon that resembles an indigo tortoise. Its head, legs, and tail stem from a cyan, hexagonal shell with the Terastal symbol on its back: a white hexagon with triangular extensions on each corner that connects it to the edges of its back. Its neck and legs each have a cyan star and ring rub, its feet each have three toes, and its tail is indigo with a cyan four-pointed star at the tip. It has two light blue eyes with rouge rimming and star-shaped pupils. It has a diamond-like pattern on its forehead and two diamonds hanging like earrings on both sides of its head. lastly, it has a \"ponytail\" made up of three segments of diamond-like shapes. The segments reduce in size as they get farther from the head and gain a purplish tint to them.\nNormal Form Terapagos is said to have a splendid aura. It is a small and particularly weak Pok\u00e9mon, but it is capable of assuming a dormant state when it needs to slumber or when its life is in danger, pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and shrinking in size, which makes itself look like an ordinary jewel.[1] It also has the ability to crystallize the energy in its body to form a protective shield around itself when necessary, even in its dormant state. This species is seemingly able to live for millions of years while slumbering within its crystal shell. Terapagos inhabited the Paldea region in a bygone era. It was thought that this species went extinct, with it said to have been caught up in seismic shifts that occurred about 2,000,000 years ago. However, one Terapagos managed to survive by crystallizing its own body and going into hibernation in the Area Zero Underdepths, where it laid low until the present day.[2] According to Briar, Terapagos is made of Terastal energy. Terapagos assumes its Normal Form when not battling and moving around.\nHeath is the one who discovered Terapagos and coined its name.[3] Professor SadaS/Professor TuroV did research on this Pok\u00e9mon while in Area Zero. Terapagos appears to naturally cause glowing crystals to grow around it as it slumbers, which gave Area Zero the distinctive appearance it possesses. For a long time, many thought Terapagos was fake and that Heath had made it up, but Briar proved its existence by writing her own book, detailing the expedition she, Carmine, Kieran, and the player had in Area Zero Underdepths.\nThe Area Zero journals and the Scarlet BookS/Violet BookV imply that Terapagos is responsible for the Terastal phenomenon, which is ultimately confirmed to be the case in the Pok\u00e9dex. With the power of its crystals, Terapagos can bombard its foes with countless star-shaped projectiles. Terapagos also has the ability to alter timelines in some capacity, as seen both in the games and in the anime, and is able to bring humans and objects either from other points in the Pok\u00e9mon world's timeline[4] or from other timelines altogether[5] to the point in time and space it currently is. When using its timeline-altering powers, a mist appears around the affected area; once it disappears, whatever was brought is sent back. The true limits of this power are currently unknown, but seems to affect humans and objects differently, as the player was able to keep the copy of the Scarlet BookS/Violet BookV owned by the professor after the encounter at Kitakami's Crystal Pool. Due to the Terastal energy it produces, Terapagos appears to have some sort of connection to the Paradox Pok\u00e9mon and is implied to be responsible for allowing advanced technologies, such as the professor's sophisticated AI and the \"time machine\", to exist in spite of human limitations.\nTerapagos can give a Tera Orb the ability to Terastallize Pok\u00e9mon with no charging drawbacks.[6] Terapagos is also the source and creator of the Stellar Tera Type, a unique Tera Type that contains the powers of each and every type.[7] Unlike other Pok\u00e9mon, it will always receive the full benefits of the Stellar Tera Type, even outside of Tera Raid Battles.\nTerapagos is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Tera Starstorm.

    "Pecharunt": {
        "number": "#1025",
        "biology": "Pecharunt is a small Pok\u00e9mon resembling a piece of mochi. It has two forms it can take both inside and outside of battle. The first form resembles an upside-down peach, with a black circular face at the center and a thin, vertical line splitting its body into two halves. In its face are two white semicircle eyes, appearing to be frowning. It takes its second form upon opening up, revealing a smaller inner body resembling a peach's pit. It has a darker purple and pink body with two white eyes which are usually frowning, below which is a white, ribbon-shaped mouth. On its head rests two purple flaps and a scorpion-like ponytail. It has two heart-shaped paws at the bottom of its body, along with three black dots on each side underneath them. The discarded shell floats on both sides of Pecharunt, forming spiky wing-like appendages. The inside of these shells have a bright pink glow, outlined in black. The bright pink extends slightly through the black outline in six thin lines. The chains have a magenta color to them and are divided in identical segments, ending in a slightly larger segment with two protrusions, making it resemble the shape of Pecharunt's shell.\nAccording to the player, Pecharunt smells incredibly sweet.[1] It is known to cry and act like a baby in order to gain sympathy from others.[2] If mortally wounded, Pecharunt will retreat into its shell and remain asleep for years. In Kitakami, it is known as the \"Never-Rotting Peach\".\nPecharunt stores poison in its peach-shaped shell and uses it to create toxic chains and roll up poisonous Binding Mochi, which are stored in its shell until they are needed. It is able to use its toxic chains in combat, badly poisoning its enemies in the process. The chains are also capable of empowering other Pok\u00e9mon, using its toxins to enhance certain aspects of their bodies, such as their muscles, brain, or looks, as seen with the Loyal Three. It serves its mochi to Pok\u00e9mon and humans, but may also shoot them at their mouths if necessary. According to Penny, the mochi that Pecharunt creates are somewhat sweet. The mochi draw out their deepest desires and powers, but the ones who eat it become chained to its will as seen with its caretakers, who had their greed drawn out, but in some cases, the ones that eat it may completely fall under its control, as seen with Mossui Town's residents and the player's Paldean friends. The only known way to eliminate Pecharunt's influence is by catching either it or those tied to it; the latter is implied by Pecharunt's reaction to any of the Loyal Three fighting against it, as they no longer appear to be chained to its will.\nHumans under Pecharunt's control have purple eyes and are surrounded by a purple aura. The controlled humans also hold their arms while performing a chicken dance-like movement, repeating the word \"mochi\" constantly. However, in some cases, like with Hideko, it is shown that the possessed human can still speak somewhat freely, though it may simply be Pecharunt influencing the propagation of the mochi among humans. Humans under its influence are often still prone to innate emotion and desires \u2014 Arven is visibly embarrassed while dancing, Penny instinctively combines the word \"mochi\" with \"Veevee\", and Nemona still expresses a strong urge to battle, being able to morph \"mochi\" into \"match\". It can even command humans or even Pok\u00e9mon to fight for it in battles, managing to control multiple humans at once. It relies on others to fight for it due to its cowardly personality and size. However, Pecharunt will fight back if it is left with no other option. Capturing Pecharunt will free those under its control with no memories of being controlled. The effect of Pecharunt's mochi on people are likened by Kieran to a curse.\nAccording to myth, Pecharunt came from a distant land where it was adopted by an elderly couple with no children. Pecharunt fed its adoptive parents Binding Mochi to secure their affection, which brought out their inner greed. They made many requests of Pecharunt, who gave them what they requested to be showered with further attention. The couple eventually asked for four shining masks, which could only be found in Kitakami. Pecharunt left to obtain the masks, recruiting Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti to aid in its quest. They successfully stole three masks from Ogerpon, who defeated the Loyal Three in retaliation; Pecharunt only survived by going dormant within its shell. It would not surface found again until hundreds of years later when a Mythical Pecha Berry awoke it.\nPecharunt is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Malignant Chain. It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Poison Puppeteer as an Ability.\n"
